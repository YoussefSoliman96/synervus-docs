## Understanding the Basics

Think of Synervus as your AI command center. Let's break down the main components:

### Workspaces 🏢

A workspace is like a company or team folder. It's where you:

- Keep all your AI assistants together
- Manage who can access what
- Track how much you're using
- Set up billing

**Example:** A marketing agency might have one workspace for their team, with different AI assistants for each client.

### Studios 🎨

Studios are your individual AI assistants. Each studio is like a specialized employee that can:

- Handle specific tasks (like customer service or sales)
- Have its own knowledge and training
- Use different tools (like email or calendar)
- Remember conversations with users

**Example:** You might have one studio for customer support and another for lead generation.

### Knowledge Base 📚

This is what your AI knows. There are two ways to give your AI knowledge:

1. **Crawl Jobs** 🕷️

   - Point to websites you want the AI to learn from
   - Upload documents (like PDFs or Word files)
   - Add text directly

2. **KB Packages** 📦
   - Pre-made knowledge sets you can subscribe to
   - Share knowledge between different studios
   - Knowledge that updates automatically

**Example:** For a tech support AI, you might crawl your help center website and upload your product manuals.

### Tools 🛠️

Tools are what your AI can do besides just chat. For example:

- Send emails
- Schedule meetings
- Look up customer information
- Create tickets

You can turn tools on or off for each studio, like giving different permissions to different employees.

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Set Up Your Workspace**

   - Sign up for Synervus
   - Create a workspace (like "My Company")
   - Add team members if needed

2. **Create Your First Studio**

   - Choose a profile picture and personality

3. **Add Knowledge**

   - Upload your important documents
   - Add website URLs to crawl
   - Browse KB packages to subscribe to

4. **Enable Tools**

   - Pick which tools your AI needs
   - Add necessary connections (like email accounts)
   - Test each tool works

5. **Launch Your AI**
   - Test it internally first
   - Make adjustments as needed
   - Share it with your team or customers

## Tips for Success

- Start small: Begin with one specific use case

### Studios 🎨

Studios are where you build and configure your AI agents. Each studio represents a unique AI assistant with its own:

- Knowledge base
- Conversation history
- Tool configurations
- Response templates

Think of studios as individual AI agents, each specialized for different tasks or departments.

### Knowledge Base 📚

The knowledge base is your AI's custom training data, which can be created through:

1. **Crawl Jobs** 🕷️

   - Web crawling of specified URLs
   - File uploads (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
   - Custom text input

2. **KB Packages** 📦
   - Pre-built knowledge sets
   - Shareable between studios
   - Auto-updating content
