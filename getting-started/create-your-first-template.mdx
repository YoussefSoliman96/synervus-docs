## What are Templates?

Templates are pre-written response patterns that help your AI communicate consistently. Think of them as conversation guides that help your AI:

- Maintain a consistent tone
- Include all necessary information
- Handle common situations professionally
- Save time on repetitive tasks

## When Do You Need a Template?

You should create a template when you need your AI to:

1. **Handle Common Scenarios**

   - Greeting new customers
   - Answering frequently asked questions
   - Collecting specific information
   - Closing conversations

2. **Maintain Consistency**

   - Brand voice and tone
   - Required disclaimers
   - Company policies
   - Support procedures

3. **Guide Complex Interactions**
   - Multi-step processes
   - Form filling
   - Troubleshooting guides
   - Handoff to human agents

## Template Examples

### 1. Welcome Message

```markdown
Hi {{user.name}}! ðŸ‘‹
I'm {{assistant.name}}, your AI assistant at {{company.name}}. I'm here to help you with:
Product information
Technical support
Order status
General inquiries
How can I assist you today?
```

### 2. Information Collection

```markdown
To better assist you, I'll need a few details:
Your order number (if applicable)
A brief description of your issue
Any error messages you're seeing
Please provide as much information as you can.
```

## When to Use Existing Templates vs Create New Ones

### Use Existing Templates When:

- Handling standard situations (greetings, goodbyes)
- Following common business processes
- Using proven conversation flows
- Needing quick deployment

### Create New Templates When:

- Addressing unique business needs
- Implementing specific procedures
- Handling industry-specific requirements
- Creating branded experiences

## Best Practices

1. **Keep It Natural**

   - Write like a human would speak
   - Avoid robotic language
   - Include personality touches

2. **Be Clear and Concise**

   - Use simple language
   - Break information into chunks
   - Include clear calls to action

3. **Use Variables Wisely**

   - Customer name and details
   - Company information
   - Dynamic data (order numbers, dates)
   - Context-specific information

4. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Try different user inputs
   - Check all variable replacements
   - Verify tone and clarity
   - Test edge cases

## Template Structure

Every template should include:

1. **Purpose**: What the template is for
2. **Variables**: What dynamic information is needed
3. **Flow**: How the conversation should progress
4. **Fallbacks**: What to do if something goes wrong
